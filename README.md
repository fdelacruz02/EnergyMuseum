# What we did
We created a 3D representation of various forms of energy production to inform people to make better decisions. We also included a pie chart representing the percetage of power outages in each of the major cities we covered and had additional data showing specifically the percentage of power outages in underrepresented communities.
# Our process
We came up with the idea on the spot and spent the first 4 to 6 hours doing research, 3D modeling, and validating data. Our next phase were spent integrating 3D models with our website and verifiying the numbers for our data set. The final phase was spent dealing with camera angles, troubleshooting MongoDB, using a text file as a solution, and adding our graphs to our website.
# What went wrong
Our MongoDB integration did not work. Our initial plan of using APIs to get our data was expensive, unreliable, and unstructured. We quickly switched to gathering our own data the proper way.
# Our thoughts
We had issues because we attempted to use technology we were not familiar with; if we stuck to technology we had a history of using, we would have avoided a lot of struggles.
